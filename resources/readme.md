- Video clips
- Share in a way so the instructions could be sent using low bandwidth:

  > Some people use networks from home routers placed in the streets to provide paid Wi-Fi access, you can say this is 95% of internet in Gaza. Even then, the connection is very weak and unstable — usually around 1 Mbps or less.. The remaining 5% go to places with slightly better connections (maybe up to 10 Mbps), but it's more expensive.
