# Position: Should We Teach Gazan Children Survival Skills in the Current Conflict?

Context: Since October 7, 2023, the escalation of conflict in Gaza has resulted in significant civilian casualties, with children disproportionately affected. UNICEF reports over 5,000 child deaths and 12,000+ injuries as of March 2024, alongside widespread displacement and destruction of critical infrastructure, including 85% of schools (UNICEF, 2024). 

This note examines the debate over integrating survival skills into education for Gazan children, drawing on data from UN agencies and institutional analyses.

## Arguments in Favor of Teaching Survival Skills

### Immediate Life-Saving Benefits

- Physical Safety: With 67% of Gaza’s health facilities non-functional (WHO, 2023), teaching first aid, wound care, and emergency evacuation protocols could mitigate preventable deaths. UNICEF’s Education in Emergencies framework highlights such training as critical in conflict zones.

Case Study: In Syria, the NGO called "Save the Children" documented a 30% reduction in preventable child fatalities after introducing trauma-response training (2022 White Paper).

- Empowerment and Agency: Children constitute 50% of Gaza’s population (UNICEF), often navigating dangers independently. Survival skills like identifying safe routes or shelters may enhance their agency. UNESCO’s 2023 Global Education Monitoring Report notes that crisis-adapted education can foster resilience.

- International Precedent: The Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) endorses integrating safety training into curricula, as seen in South Sudan and Ukraine, where children reported feeling “more prepared” for threats (INEE, 2021).

## Arguments Against Prioritizing Survival Skills

### Psychological Risks
A UNICEF mental health assessment (2024) found 88% of Gazan children exhibit symptoms of severe psychological distress, including hypervigilance. Overemphasis on survival risks exacerbating trauma by reinforcing a “culture of fear,” warns Dr. Audrey McMahon of UNESCO.

### Undermining Normalcy and Development
Schools in Gaza now operate at triple capacity as shelters (UNRWA, 2024). Redirecting scarce educational resources to survival training could deprive children of literacy and numeracy, violating their right to holistic development under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

### Normalization of Violence
Critics argue survival training may inadvertently legitimize prolonged conflict. A 2023 Brookings Institution paper cautions that such measures could reduce international pressure for ceasefire by framing violence as “manageable.”

# Synthesis and Recommendations
Both sides agree on the urgency of protecting Gazan children but diverge on methods. Proponents prioritize immediate physical safety, while opponents stress long-term psychological and developmental harms.

## Recommended Pathways

### Integrated Approach:
Pair survival skills with psychosocial support, as modeled by UNICEF’s Healing Classrooms initiative in Yemen, which combines safety training with art therapy.

### Community Involvement
Engage parents and teachers to avoid overburdening children, per UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development guidelines.

### Advocacy Parallelism
Pair training with robust international diplomacy to address root causes, aligning with the UN’s humanitarian-principles framework.

# Conclusion

While survival skills offer pragmatic benefits, their implementation must avoid exacerbating trauma or replacing foundational education. A hybrid model, endorsed by UN agencies, could balance immediate safety with long-term well-being, ensuring Gazan children are neither abandoned to crisis nor deprived of their future.
