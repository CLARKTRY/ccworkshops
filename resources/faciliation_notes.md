# Tips on facilitating co-creation sessions 

When faciliating between traumatized Palestinians with lived experiences in Gaza and non-Palestinians, we may want to adopt a
deliberate, trauma-informed approach that centers equity, cultural humility, and empowerment. 

Below is a structured strategy to address power imbalances and foster meaningful collaboration:

### **1. Pre-Session Preparation: Building Trust and Safety**
- **Trauma-Informed Facilitation**: 
  - Train facilitators in trauma-informed practices to recognize triggers, ensure psychological safety, and avoid retraumatization.
  - Include Palestinian co-facilitators or cultural liaisons to bridge trust gaps.
- **Compensation and Recognition**: Compensate Palestinian participants equitably for their time and expertise. Acknowledge their contributions publicly and in documentation.
- **Logistical Support**: Ensure reliable virtual access (e.g., stable internet, electricity backups) for Gazan participants. Provide technical assistance and flexible timing to accommodate unstable conditions.

### **2. Session Design: Centering Palestinian Voices**
- **Leadership Roles**: Involve Palestinians in designing the agenda and co-leading sessions. Use a "nothing about us without us" framework to ensure decision-making power is shared.
- **Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity**: Use bilingual facilitators and materials. Validate storytelling, art, and non-verbal expression as legitimate forms of knowledge-sharing.
- **Structured Equity**: Implement round-robin sharing, timed speaking slots, or a "talking piece" to prevent dominance by non-Palestinian voices. Prioritize Palestinian narratives in discussions.

### **3. Creating a Safe Emotional Environment**
- **Optional Sharing**: Begin with optional check-ins, allowing participants to share experiences without pressure. Avoid forcing disclosure of trauma.
- **Mental Health Support**: Have counselors or trauma specialists on standby. Offer private breakout rooms for decompression.
- **Acknowledge Power Dynamics**: Explicitly address historical and systemic inequalities at the outset. Encourage non-Palestinians to practice active listening and humility.

### **4. Inclusive Co-Creation Methods**
- **Multiple Avenues for Input**: Use mixed methods (e.g., written feedback, art, small-group discussions) to accommodate diverse communication styles.
- **Strengths-Based Framing**: Highlight Palestinians' expertise in survival, resilience, and community-building. Frame their lived experiences as critical assets to the process.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Leverage visual mapping, participatory design, or digital platforms that democratize input (e.g., Miro boards, shared documents).

### **5. Post-Session Accountability**
- **Tangible Outcomes**: Ensure Palestinian input directly shapes decisions, policies, or projects. Publish clear commitments and timelines for implementation.
- **Ongoing Engagement**: Create mechanisms for continued Palestinian involvement (e.g., advisory boards, feedback loops). Avoid extractive "one-off" engagements.
- **Transparency and Feedback**: Share session outcomes with all participants and solicit feedback on the process. Adjust future sessions based on Palestinian evaluations.

### **6. Addressing Structural Challenges**
- **Advocacy for Access**: Partner with NGOs to pressure for humanitarian access, enabling safer participation (e.g., secure spaces, resources for Gazans).
- **Cultural Humility Training**: Require non-Palestinian participants to undergo training on Gazaâ€™s historical context, systemic oppression, and their own privileges.

## **Example Framework for a Session**

1. **Opening Ritual**: Moment of silence or grounding exercise led by a Palestinian participant.
2. **Agenda Review**: Co-presented by Palestinian and non-Palestinian facilitators.
3. **Small-Group Dialogues**: Mixed groups with prompts focused on Gaza-specific challenges and solutions.
4. **Creative Expression**: Art or storytelling stations to capture experiences non-verbally.
5. **Synthesis and Commitments**: Document shared priorities and assign accountability for next steps.

## **Key Considerations**

- **Avoid Savior Complexes**: Non-Palestinians should support, not lead. 
- **Validate Emotional Labor**: Recognize the toll of sharing traumatic experiences and provide ongoing support.
- **Leverage Allies**: Encourage non-Palestinians to amplify Palestinian voices and challenge inequitable dynamics in real time.

By prioritizing safety, equity, and systemic accountability, co-creation sessions can transform power imbalances into opportunities for solidarity and justice.
