## Lesson Plan: Resilience & Storytelling - Managing a Class of 100 in a Gaza Refugee Camp (Conflict Times)

**Target Audience:** Teachers working with a class of approximately 100 students in a Gaza refugee camp during active conflict. (Adjustable based on age range - this plan leans towards late elementary/early middle school, 10-14 years old, but with adaptations it can be modified.  Explicitly acknowledging the range is vital.)
**Context:**  Students are likely experiencing trauma, displacement, loss, and ongoing fear. Safety and emotional well-being are paramount.  Resources are scarce, and the learning environment is likely unstable (e.g., tents, crowded spaces, limited materials).  Regular schooling is disrupted.  This lesson prioritizes psychosocial support interwoven with simple educational activities.
**Lesson Duration:** 60-90 minutes (can be broken into shorter segments)
**Overall Goal:** To provide a safe space for students to express their experiences and emotions, foster a sense of community and resilience, and offer a brief respite from the realities of conflict.

**I. Core Principles & Teacher Considerations (Before the Lesson):**

* **Safety First:**  Prioritize physical and emotional safety. Be aware of potential triggers (sounds, images, topics). Have a pre-determined signal for stopping the activity if students become overwhelmed.
* **Trauma-Informed Approach:**  Do *not* force sharing. Allow students to participate only if they feel comfortable.  Validate their feelings; avoid minimizing or dismissing their experiences.  Focus on strengths and coping mechanisms.
* **Flexibility:**  Be prepared to adjust the lesson based on the students' needs and the current situation.  Conflict-related events might necessitate cancelling or altering the plan.
* **Collaboration:** Work with other teachers, aid workers, and community leaders to identify students who may require additional support.
* **Self-Care:**  This work is emotionally demanding. Teachers need to prioritize their own well-being to effectively support their students.
* **Limited Materials:** Plan activities requiring minimal resources.  Focus on oral storytelling, drawing with available materials (charcoal, sand, sticks), or using shared spaces.
* **Age Range Awareness:** 100 students is a *huge* group. Expect varying emotional maturity. Divide into smaller groups where feasible.  Simpler activities for younger students, more reflective prompts for older ones.



**II. Lesson Components:**

**Phase 1: Check-In & Safe Space Creation (10-15 minutes)**

* **Greeting & Ground Rules (Simplified):** Start with a calm greeting.  Establish 2-3 simple ground rules:
    *  "We listen to each other respectfully."
    *  "You only share what you feel comfortable sharing."
    * "We are here to support each other."
* **"Rose, Bud, Thorn" Activity (Adaptation for large groups):** Instead of individual sharing, have students visualize these within themselves:
    * **Rose:** Something good that happened recently (even small).
    * **Bud:** Something they are hopeful for.
    * **Thorn:** Something difficult they are facing.  *Stress: They do not need to verbalize the thorn.*
    *  **Large Group Visualization:** Guide students through a quiet moment of thinking about each element.  You can gently ask (but don't push) if anyone *wants* to share.  Acknowledge any shares with empathy.
* **Deep Breathing Exercise (Simple):** Lead a simple breathing exercise: "Breathe in slowly, like you are smelling a flower. Breathe out slowly, like you are blowing out a candle." Repeat 3-5 times.

**Phase 2:  Storytelling & Resilience â€“ "My Strong Tree" (30-45 minutes)**

* **Introduction (5 mins):**  Explain that everyone has inner strength, even when things are hard.  Today, they will explore that strength through a story.
* **The Metaphor:**  Introduce the idea of a tree:
    * **Roots:** Represent family, community, culture, and things that keep them grounded.
    * **Trunk:** Represents their own strength and resilience.
    * **Branches:** Represent hopes, dreams, and things they are good at.
    * **Leaves:** Represent memories, experiences, and the people they care about.
* **Activity Options (Choose one or adapt based on resources):**
    * **Oral Storytelling (Recommended):**
        * **Small Group Discussion (Divide into groups of 8-10):** Have students discuss: "What are the 'roots' that keep you strong? What makes your 'trunk' strong? What are your 'branches' reaching for?" (Facilitators/teachers move between groups, gently encouraging participation).
        * **Large Group Sharing (Optional):**  Invite a few students (who *want* to) to share a few sentences about their trees. *Emphasize:  Sharing is completely optional.*
    * **Drawing Activity (If materials are available):**  Have students draw their "Strong Tree" using charcoal, sand, or sticks.  Focus on the *symbols* they use to represent their roots, trunk, and branches.
    * **Collective Tree (If limited materials):**  Create a large "tree" on the ground using stones, sticks, or sand.  Students can contribute "leaves" (small stones/symbols) representing people they love or things they are grateful for.
* **Facilitation Notes:**
    *  *Listen actively and validate their experiences.*
    *  *Focus on strengths and coping mechanisms.*
    *  *Reframe negative experiences as opportunities for growth.*
    *  *Avoid probing for details about trauma.*
    *  *Encourage positive self-talk.*



**Phase 3:  Closure & Future Hopes (10-15 minutes)**

* **"One Good Thing" Sharing:**  Ask students to think of "one good thing" that happened during the lesson or that they are grateful for.  (Again, optional sharing).
* **Future Hope Visualization:**  "Imagine one small thing you hope for in the future."  Have students close their eyes and visualize it.
* **Reinforce Resilience:** Remind students that they are strong and capable, even in difficult times.  "You have survived a lot, and you continue to be resilient."
* **Closing Circle:**  End with a calm closing statement: "We are here for each other. We will continue to support each other."




**III.  Important Adaptations & Considerations:**

* **Age Range:**  Younger students might need simpler prompts and more visual aids. Older students can engage in more reflective discussions.
* **Trauma Triggers:** Be prepared to stop the activity if students become overwhelmed. Have a quiet space available for students who need a break.
* **Language Barriers:** Use simple language and visual aids.  Utilize bilingual facilitators if possible.
* **Physical Limitations:**  Ensure that the activity is accessible to students with physical disabilities.
* **Ongoing Support:** This lesson is a starting point.  Provide ongoing support and create a safe space for students to express their emotions.



**Resources (Minimal):**

* Charcoal, sticks, sand (if available)
* Stones
* Facilitators/teachers who are trained in trauma-informed care.
*  A quiet space for students who need a break.




**Disclaimer:** This lesson plan is designed for a specific context and should be adapted based on the needs of the students and the resources available. It is important to consult with experts in trauma-informed care and local communities to ensure that the lesson is culturally appropriate and effective.
