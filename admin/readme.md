# Our Shared Ethos

We come together to co-create, imagine, and build despite immense challenges. 

Inspired by Palestinian values of sumud (صمود), ihtiram (احترام – respect), karam (كرم – generosity), and takaful (تكافل – mutual care), we are committed to building a respectful, healing, and empowering space for all participants.

This workshop is not just about generating ideas — it’s about affirming dignity, preserving hope, and collaborating across distance and difference with deep care.

# Core Principles
## Respect and Dignity (احترام وكرامة)
We treat each other with deep respect. Every participant brings valuable lived experience, cultural insight, and knowledge. We honor and affirm that.

## Solidarity and Mutual Care (تضامن وتكافل)
We recognize the heavy realities many participants face, especially those in Gaza. We hold space for one another with compassion and care, knowing that healing and expression are acts of resistance.

## Co-Creation, Not Extraction
We create with each other, not for or about others. We listen deeply, ensure consent, and center local knowledge and agency.

## Safety and Consent
Everyone has the right to participate, speak, or stay silent without pressure. We respect boundaries and create a space free of judgment or harm.

## Equity and Inclusion
No voice is too small, no idea is too naïve. We actively include participants of all genders, abilities, languages, and backgrounds, making room for those most often left out.

## Confidentiality and Trust
What is shared in this space stays in this space, unless clear consent is given to share. Trust is our most valuable collective resource.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

The following actions will not be tolerated:
- Any form of harassment, including mocking, bullying, or discriminatory remarks
- Exclusion or silencing of participants based on gender, political views, religion, or location
- Disruption that violates the spirit of mutual respect and shared purpose

~~Appropriation or use of Palestinian stories or ideas without acknowledgment and permission~~

## Accountability and Reporting

If you witness or experience any violation of these values, please reach out directly to the organizers at ccw4gaza <at> gmail.com. All reports will be kept confidential and taken seriously.
