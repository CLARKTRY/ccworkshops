# Co-Creation Workshops 2025

**Who are we and what are we doing?** 

Design4Good is a volunteer not-for-profit group dedicated to supporting children in Gaza, led by faculty members from [Birzeit University](https://www.birzeit.edu/en/rebuilding-hope) and University College of Applied Sciences, as well as members from Canada, Indonesia, Japan. 

We are currently focused on education: helping children in Gaza return to learning during these immensely difficult times via new teaching/ learning strategies. 

In doing so, we are hosting a series of virtual workshops that will bring together local Palestinians and advocates from around the world to co-create solutions with prototyping stages embedded into our workshops. 

***Remote participants will participate by donation, with 100% of the funds directly wired to families in Gaza.***

<details> 

<summary>Q1: How is this initative different from Workshops4Gaza?</summary>

<br/>

Answer: While both initiatives aim to support Gaza, our approach differs from [Workshops4Gaza](https://www.workshops4gaza.com/). We're focusing on addressing the critical shortage of essential items, particularly food, and the inability of many families to access donations. Our initiative crowdsources both money *and* expertise to develop practical solutions for children coping with hunger and trauma while learning. Unlike Workshops4Gaza, which organizes workshops and classes to raise money for Palestinians in Gaza, our effort is centered on collaborative problem-solving to tackle the immediate needs of Gaza's children.

<summary>Q2: What unique value does your initiative bring to supporting Gaza's children, compared to other fundraising or advocacy efforts such as the many GoFundMe campaigns out there?</summary>

<br/>

Answer: Firstly, we aim to bring a unique value to supporting Gaza's children by focusing on education and psychosocial support, addressing the root causes of their struggles. Unlike traditional fundraising efforts that often focus on immediate relief, we're working to develop sustainable solutions that empower children to cope with trauma and build resilience for use during and after the war.

Secondly, through our co-creation workshops and collaboration with global advocates and experts, we're generating innovative ideas and practical solutions that can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact.
