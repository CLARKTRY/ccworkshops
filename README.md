# Co-Creation Workshops 2025

**Who are we?** 

Design4Good is a volunteer not-for-profit group dedicated to supporting children in Gaza, led by faculty members from Birzeit University and University College of Applied Sciences, as well as members from Canada, Indonesia, Japan. 

We are currently focused on education: helping children in Gaza return to learning during these immensely difficult times via new teaching/ learning strategies. 

In doing so, we are hosting a series of virtual workshops that will bring together local Palestinians and advocates from around the world to co-create solutions with prototyping stages embedded into our workshops. 

***Remote participants will participate by donation, with 100% of the funds directly wired to Gaza families.***

## Q&A

<details> 
<summary>How is this initative different from Workshops4Gaza?</summary>

Gaza is facing a dire shortage of essential items, with food stocks critically low. Despite donations being wired to families in Gaza, they're unable to access these funds to purchase food. We're calling on global advocates to join forces to address this crisis immediately, rather than turning a blind eye to what seems like an insurmountable problem
