# Co-creation Workshops 2025

*Bridging Innovation and Impact with AI*

**Who are we?** Design4Good is a volunteer not-for-profit group dedicated to supporting children in Gaza, led by faculty members from Birzeit University and University College of Applied Sciences, as well as members from Canada, Japan, Indonesia. 

We are currently focused on education: helping children in Gaza return to learning during these immensely difficult times via new teaching/ learning strategies. 

In doing so, we are hosting a series of virtual workshops that will bring together local Palestinians and advocates from around the world to co-create solutions with prototyping stages embedded into our workshops.
